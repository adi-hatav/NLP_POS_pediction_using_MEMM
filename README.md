### NLP - parts of speech prediction 

This project was an exercise as part of an NLP (natural language processing) course.

In this project the task was parts of speech (POS) tagging.
To perform this task, a maximum-entropy Markov model (MEMM) was used and a Viterbi algorithm was implemented with a Markovian assumption of current tag dependence with the two previous tags.

The data sets:
- A large training set including 5000 sentences and their parts of speech tagging.
- A small training set including 250 sentences and their parts of speech tagging.
- a test set of size 1000 for the large training set.
- Two competition files for labeling: one will be labeled after training on the large training set, and the other after training on the small training set.

We reached an accuracy percentage of 96.3% on the test set, the highest accuracy percentage out of 225 students.
